# Python-Project- 
Project - Rock, Paper , Scissor

Here's a description of how the project could be implemented:

User Interface:

The project starts by displaying a welcome message and the rules of the game to the players.
Each player is prompted to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) through the command line or a graphical interface.
The game has 5 rounds and the final result will be based on that only.
Input Validation:

The program checks if the user's input is valid. It verifies that the input is either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors', and prompts the user to re-enter their choice if the input is invalid.
Game Logic:

Once players have made their choices, the program determines the winner based on the following rules:
Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beat paper.
Paper beats rock.
If user and computer choose the same option, the game is a tie.

Displaying Results:

The program displays the choices made by both players.
It announces the winner or declares a tie.

Looping the Game:
The game has 5 rounds and the final result will be based on that only.

Overall, this project provides a simple implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game in Python, allowing users to play against the computer or against each other. It demonstrates the usage of conditional statements, input validation, and looping to create an interactive game experience.
